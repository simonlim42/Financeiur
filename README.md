# Stock Pulse: Stock Market Alert System

## Introduction

This project consists of a web application for tracking stock prices and a background task that periodically checks the stock prices against user-defined alerts and sends Telegram notifications when the stock prices meet the specified conditions.

The aim of this project is to incorporate cutting-edge technologies into the web application, fostering both learning and integration of state-of-the-art advancements.

**Currently trying to host this application!**
